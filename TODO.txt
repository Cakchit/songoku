v0.2 TODO

1.  Make it so it only guesses the numbers every ~20 frames?
    Maybe guesses them really fast at the beginning and once it has it figured out it slows down

2.  Make numbers less shaky (better contour grabbing?)

DONE:

1.  Now guesses the numbers every 10 frames (though it still grabs every frame of video)
